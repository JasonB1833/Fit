                <p>I struggled with my weight for years growing up. During my early adulthood, I dedicated a lot of my free time to studying health and fitness to improve my own well-being. It wasn't until I joined the Marine Corps that I realized how many people face the same fitness challenges.
                    <br>
                    Joining the Marines gave me a way to help others, and that meant a lot to me. It provided a meaningful opportunity for me to make a positive impact in the lives of those facing similar struggles.

            <h3>my background with fitness</h3>
            
            
            <p> While I was in the Marine Corps, I got a job helping out Marines who didn't quite meet our fitness standards. It was like a dream gig for me.
                <br>
                In that year, I helped a bunch of Marines get back on track with their fitness, even some who were way over the limit.
                 Meanwhile, I kept learning about fitness so I could share the info and help them out.
