            <p>First and foremost this is going to be a dual purpose website/project, I want this to serve as both a résumé and also a fitness tool for anyone who may need it. I was inspired to do this through my own experience struggling with fitness and finding science backed information throughout 10 years (give or take)
                All that being said I'm hoping by the end of this becomes an easy to use tool for anyone willing to use it and a quick reference where it is needed.

                <ul>
                <li>A <a href="BMICalc.html">Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator (BMR)</a> that clearly shows your personalized BMR along with a short description of what that is, along with other useful tools.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A <a href="NutrInfo.html">Nutrition Information</a> section so that you know how to implement this knowledge</li>
                <br>
                <li>A general "<a href="About.html">About Me</a>" segment to give you an idea of who I am for résumé purposes</li>
                <br>
                <li>Links to my <a href="About.html">other projects</a> that I've been working on, and my <a href="https://github.com/JasonB1833?tab=repositories">github</a></li>

                <p>For ease of use, My website has two different types of navigation, first one is the banner on the top of the page to go between pages.
                    <br>
                    Second will only be in the more lengthy pages I will have a sidebar that helps you jump to certain spots within the page.
