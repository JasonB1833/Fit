            <h3>my background with fitness</h3>
            </div>

            <div id="textWrapper">

             <p>I struggled with my weight for years growing up. During my early adulthood, I dedicated a lot of my free time to studying health and fitness to improve my own well-being. It wasn't until I joined the Marine Corps that I realized how many people face the same fitness challenges.
                    
             </p>
            
            
            <p> While I was in the Marine Corps, I got a job helping out Marines who didn't quite meet our fitness standards. It was like a dream gig for me.
                <br>
                In that year, I helped over a hundred Marines get back on track with their fitness, even some who were way over the limit.
                 Meanwhile, I kept learning about fitness so I could share the info and help them out.
            </p>
                <div class="calculator">
                <p>hence the theme of this whole website</p>

                
                </div>

            <div class="calculator"> 
            <h1>Mission statement:</h1>
            </div>
            <p>First and foremost this is going to be a dual purpose website/project, I want this to serve as both a résumé and also a fitness tool for anyone who may need it. I was inspired to do this through my own experience struggling with fitness and finding science backed information throughout 10 years (give or take)
                All that being said I'm hoping by the end, this becomes an easy to use tool for anyone willing to use it and a quick reference where it is needed.
