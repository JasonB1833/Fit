          Welcome to our Nutritional Information Wiki, your go-to guide for nailing your daily caloric intake and rocking those fitness goals. We've got the lowdown based on solid science, but hey, for that extra personalized touch, chatting with healthcare professionals or registered dietitians is always a good idea.

            <h2 id="section1">What’s with these calculations? (BMR) (TDEE)</h2>
            <p>
              Now I know what you’re thinking “Acronyms?!?! Yuck!” well I know its intimidating but it doesn’t have to be. Fitness is a science like any other and unfortunately that requires some math but its quite simple when you get down to it. Our first variable we’re going to learn about is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). BMR is the calories your body would need just to exist without any form of day to day activities. Thankfully we have a handy calculator for you Here but if you’re interested in the math of it all here is the equation you would use to find it:
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <table> 
              <tr>
              <th>For men:</th>

              <td>BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677  x age in years) </td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr>
              <th>For women:</th>
                                 
              <td>BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years) </td>
              </tr>

            </table>

            <p>
              You’ll notice in our calculator page we ask for your activity level as well, that helps us determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) which is a fancy way of saying the calories your body needs in a day to include your activity level, This is the number we want to work around to achieve our goals.
            </p>

            
            <h2 id="section2">Setting Caloric Intake for Your Goals</h2>
            <p>
              So that explains basically everything our fancy pants calculator does for you for you nerdy types. Now that we’ve gotten passed the hardest part of the process (being the math) now for the most important question is , “how do I use this number to my advantage?” Well its simple, if you want to lose weight then take Your TDEE that you pulled from our calculator and ensure that your daily intake of calories is 200-500 calories LESS than that. So if my TDEE was 2500 I would eat between 2000-2300 calories a day if that were my goal. And vice versa if I had wanted to gain weight, I would be eating between 2700 to 3000 calories a day. Its really that simple (not including macros) however you cant forget that these calculations would constantly shift with your weight changing as well so as you continue your journey don’t be afraid to recalculate your numbers to ensure that you don’t stop making progress, I had found that it was best to run the numbers every month or so just to ensure that you don’t stall and lose hope.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
              Now with all that being said its important that I note this: DO NOT OVERDO THIS, YOU  WILL NOT GET TO YOUR GOAL WEIGHT FASTER BY EATING 800-1000 CALORIES LESS THAN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO. Physical fitness is a marathon not a sprint please don’t hurt yourself trying to achieve your goal, you will only get discouraged or develop an eating disorder, trust me. If you have any other specific personalized goals in mind don’t hesitate to consult an expert
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h2 id="section3">Choosing The Right Foods</h2>
            <p>
             So by now everyone has heard of the food groups and the food pyramid and blah blah blah. Don’t worry about any of that, that’s overcomplicating it all. I’m going to make it really REALLY easy for my readers here, if it grows from the ground (veggies/ fruits/ etc.) or is raised in a farm (Beef/Chicken/etc.) and HASN’T been dunked in a vat of frying oil, and DOESN’T have psychedelic properties to it, eat it. This might be an oversimplification but its just that easy, the most important part is that you’re eating REAL food like Potatoes and chicken or broccoli and not just indulging on sweets for all of your meals to add up to 2500 calories a day of just pumpkin pie. Just ensure that your meals are varied to give you a wide range of nutrients, and it doesn’t even need to be super strict either so long as your every meal isn’t deep fried that’s all you really need to know. Now if you have very specific athletic goals in mind like playing a sport that requires you to gain muscle and keep off the fat you would want to refer to the Macros section after this one.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            
            <h2 id="section4">Macro and Micronutrients</h2>
            <p>
              For muscle gain, aim for a calorie surplus. Prioritize protein for muscle growth and balance macronutrients for overall health.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h2 id="section5">Macro and Micronutrients</h2>
            <p>
              Now your daily calorie requirement is just the surface level of fitness and a majority of the population would be just fine with that knowledge given they eat a varied diet, but for you athletic types that have already gotten into the groove of counting your calories and consistently moving your body (especially athletes with specific goals in mind i.e. significant muscle gain) you’ll want to take a look at your macros to help you get to the next level.
               Macronutrients (proteins, carbs, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) are vital for your health, you’ve probably heard these terms thrown around quite a lot and probably wondered how they play a part thankfully I’m about to make it even simpler for you with the following. Remember these are generalized outlines and if you want a fully customized plan it would be best to speak to a professional, this info alone wont make you an NFL all-star but it’s a start to push you in the right direction.
              Just Scroll until you see your goal or jump to it using the side-nav bar:
